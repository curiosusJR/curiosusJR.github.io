[Skelevision](https://github.com/bcweeks/Skelevision) is a wonderful work which is a automatically protocol to measure birds bones using man-made labels. When I see those skeletal specimens, I think they are kind of similar to insect male external genitalia. I don't have any experience with machine learning but thanks to the detailed README file of [Skelevision](https://github.com/bcweeks/Skelevision), even it starts from installing conda, I can reproduce the whole  protocol to my computer and learn it.

# Pictures Preparation
