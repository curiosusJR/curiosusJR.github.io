# Usage
## Planning
1. TODO-list is for tasks in the plan and WISH-list is for the tasks out of plan yet.
2. Add tasks should be done recently into todo-list_rust and finish them in order. 
## Documenting
3. Done the works on the todo-list everyday and summary daily work at autodaily.
4. Alias autodaily-tasks with todo-list via tags and links everyday.
5. Alias todo-list-tasks with wish-list sometime.
## Work progressing
6. Sketch my thesis on mdbook. (because markdown is easier for both documentation and presentation)
7. Sync the sketches to TODO-list (thesis theme) and break it up into exactly tasks.
8. Report my work into mdbook weekly.
## Presentation
9. Use mdbook (for short report), beamer or PPT (for formal report) to show contents in mdbook.
