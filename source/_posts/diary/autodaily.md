### Doing tasks

### Done tasks
- ‼edit my blog and organize files (10.4h)

### Todo tasks in this week
- ‼模型描述: build the zero-evolution and add para; vim zhongqi_latex/src/03_model.tex and 00-daily*.md though
- learning model adding and config in revbayes
- make a model list for revbayes P3
- 输入文件格式，即数据来源
- 研究一下qmk，把轨迹球移动之后自动切换到第三层这件事给取消掉，再看看有什么可以配置玩的。
- align with magus？
- ON dating: run muscle in align and test mode via its online document.
- alignment is not much usefull on such huge dataset, why? or these gaps is normal on such taxa_num datasets? Filt them into small dataset will influent the pps_result?
- Can I get any acceptable pps_result?
- current running : mito_dataset. mft-ginsi/magus on dating; rb_pps on tower. check the result

### Memo & Comments
- char_type:335069. 
- edit blog in autodaily, add TODOLIST/WISHLIST in hexo, edit via obsidian. 
- Write my thesis paper via mdbook; 
- Maybe I should use mdbook instead of beamer for presentation, not hexo for documentation, maybe. #mdbook #hexo #todo #obsidian #blog 
- Using todo list and hexo-blog via obsidian for daily work, using mdbook for presentation.
