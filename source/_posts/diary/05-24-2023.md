# What I have done today

1. Installed R packages `inborutils` and `devtools` for downloading the large file of  [2022SE](https://resjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/syen.12543) from `zenodo`, but the file had been downloaded by `zenodo_get` and `wget`. Considering `devtools` is a useful package for R, it does not seem to waste time for me.
2. Compared trees of outgroup with different parameters and all of them are different. The whole dataset is still downloading because the network connection of `zenodo` is not stably. 
3. Symmetric difference had been calculated by paup with command `treedist` and the `normD` (normalized different, maybe?) within inceptionResnetV2 model was 1, the largest number. **It is not a acceptable result.**
4. The SSI calculation in supplemental file 3 needs a special input format of data contained node information of trees, which may be built by paup. 
5. Prepared for trip of Shennongjia in Hubei. 

# What I need to do next

 - [x] I do not understand the meaning of 'random consensus tree' and 'consensus tree' in the article.
