# What I have done today

1. Continuous traits do not appear to be analysis by mrbayes software so I searched other methods and list below:
	1. Beast 2, which is re-write from Beast 1.x and contain more model than version 1. It also can be called in program R. [see](https://github.com/BEAST2-Dev/beast-geo/releases/download/v1.2.0/phylogeography_s.pdf)
	2. R package `Phytools` for data simulation and modeling. [see](http://www.phytools.org/Cordoba2017/ex/5/Cont-char-models.html)
	3. RevBayes. [see](https://revbayes.github.io/tutorials/cont_traits/cont_trait_intro.html)
	4. Â R package `evorates`. [see](https://github.com/bstaggmartin/evorates) (Model for traits evolutionary rates)
	So, the two useful software are Beast 2 and RevBayes. It is time to install bayesian analysis softwares and openmpi.
2. Installed `evorates` by `devtools`. Installed openmpi, mrbayes by brew and complied revbayes in mpi version locally. Complied mpich locally but I do not know how to use it with mrbayes and revbayes.
