# What I have done today

1. Added internal links among my daily blogs. [More info](https://blog.jijian.link/2020-01-08/hexo-anchor-link/#hexo-%E6%A0%87%E9%A2%98%E4%B8%8E-id-%E5%85%B3%E7%B3%BB)
	Something about attachments in blog: 
	- Configure hexo and use source file folder. Follow [this](https://hexo.io/zh-cn/docs/asset-folders).
	- `.md` files always appear on the homepage wherever it locates in sources folder or not. `.txt` will present contents on the web page. Files without `.*` will be download to local.
	- Use `[](*.*)` to cite files in source.  **`.*`** **is always suggested to be added.**
	- Obsidian is not a good tools to deal with attachments. It does not show files which is not followed by `.md`. Maybe configuring neovim more carefully is a good  idea. 
1. Configured `Aur` source for `yay` in archlinux running on my old laptop.
	In this way, the [problem](https://zhangdeweb.site/2023/04/08/04-08-2023/) of firefox has been solved by the way, which can be replaced by configures of chrome. Just do `yay -S google-chrome` and follow [this](https://onlycaptain.github.io/2018/10/01/Ubuntu%E4%B8%8Bgoogle%E4%B8%8D%E8%83%BD%E6%AD%A3%E7%A1%AE%E4%BB%A3%E7%90%86%E7%9A%84%E8%A7%A3%E5%86%B3%E6%96%B9%E6%B3%95/).
3. Tried to reproduced the [2022SE](https://resjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/syen.12543) used [scripts](https://github.com/alexander-pv/insects-recognition) from github. But my conda cannot install all dependency and stopped at train step. Maybe the configures of sources of conda is wrong. 
	The reason why I reproduced this article is that I want to try if the recognition with non-man-made annotations can split pictures and how much it refines the outlines.

# What I need to do next

1. Structures outline definition.
2. Annotation changing.
3. Traits definition. Maybe same thing to the first point.

# What I want to do in future
- Archlinux configure process.
- Conda configuration.
- Hexo or other blogs custom configure.

# What I want to tell myself
**Shortcuts** is a basic operation of daily use but I cannot use or custom them easily before, especially when I used `Vial` to custom my *ergo* keyboard. Today I get a new useful tool, `xev`, from [here](https://www.cnblogs.com/yinheyi/p/10146900.html) to confirm my key coding includes values of 'keysym' and 'keycode'. Now I can configure my own shortcuts in **i3wm** with command `bindsym` for 'keysym' and `bindcode` for 'keycode' in `~/.config/i3/config`. And here is my [config file](configfile_i3wm.txt).
