# What I have done today

1. Installed [Tex Live for unix](https://www.tug.org/texlive/quickinstall.html) but there is no package management good enough for ubuntu. `tlmgr` cannot be found in `sudo`, [see](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/203874/sudo-does-not-find-tlmgr).
2. Installed [zotero] for inserting citations in `.docx` files. The method of custom reference format can be found [here](https://blog.csdn.net/baidu_39389949/article/details/115867377), more about [CSL](https://docs.citationstyles.org/en/stable/) and [a visualize tool](https://editor.citationstyles.org/visualEditor/).
3. Installed a new WiFi router with AP mod but it cannot start ap mod successfully. So I still use dhcp. Additionally, the gateway cannot be same with ip in LAN masknet, remember to change one.
4. Ready for writing. 

# What I need to do next
