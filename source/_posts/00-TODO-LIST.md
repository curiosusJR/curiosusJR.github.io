I need a to-do list to help me organize my numerous daily tasks. This list categorizes all of things  I need to do in order of urgency. It will keep some of things that have already done for thinking over their logic when there is a complex situation. The list will be updated daily and irrelevant completed items will be cleared after about a week. If a complex task needs to be broken down into multiple subtasks, those subtasks will be listed in another file and linked here. The file list subtasks should be a document for the complex task and will be retained.

# Things I need to do **Tomorrow**
 - [ ] Build 10000 trees in one week and check it.
 - [ ] RevBayes (or Beast) can deal with continuous traits and mrbayes cannot. Try to build trees in a bayes way.
- [ ] Searching relevant literature.
- [ ] Tree-like phylogenetic relationship is or is not a best resolution of evolution? And why? Find more articles! Think about which shape of phylogenetic visualization I should use.

# Things I need to do soon 

- [ ] Add GitAction on GitHub for automatically deploying Hexo blogs.
 - [ ] **IMPORTANT!** I do not know how the numbers '1536' in traits and '813' in random selection in pictures come. Maybe it is related to model training or predicting. I should find out it some day and it can help me to know about ML.  
 - [ ] Arithmetic average cannot represent the average level of image features. I should use another method.
- [ ]  Evolution model of continuous trait can or cannot be change for better use of image?
- [ ] Are the traits extracted by models the ones I want? Should I train, even build, my own model? Or should I use model for trait extraction? The distance in the kailan-article, what exactly mean in physical or biological?

# Things I had done recently 
 - [x] Check the plots of epoch accuracy for the model. 
 - [x] Check the topology of consensus tree 
 - [x] Check the symmetric using the script in Supplement 3.
 - [x] Output the trait matrix if possible.
 - [x] Use whole dataset with different settings and model to conduct trees and check the topology. Current (newer one) parameters shows a worse result in the curve plots. Try more.
# Things I need to do sometimes
- [ ] It would be even better if the to-do list could pop up in a drop-down menu. I can create an object in github. Referring rofi source code and reading more documents will help me.
- [ ] Summarize installation and configuration of archlinux.
- [ ] Add a curtain to my tower chassis.
- [x] Learn about version corresponding or dependency among cuda, python or so on.
- [ ] Systematic learn deep learning programming.**Same to the importants above**
