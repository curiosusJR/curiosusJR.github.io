I need a to-do list to help me organize my numerous daily tasks. This list categorizes all of things  I need to do in order of urgency. It will keep some of things that have already done for thinking over their logic when there is a complex situation. The list will be updated daily and irrelevant completed items will be cleared after about a week. If a complex task needs to be broken down into multiple subtasks, those subtasks will be listed in another file and linked here. The file list subtasks should be a document for the complex task and will be retained.

# Things I need to do **Tomorrow**


# Things I need to do soon 




# Things I had done recently 
- [x] Add GitAction on GitHub for automatically deploying Hexo blogs.
# Things I need to do sometimes
- [ ] It would be even better if the to-do list could pop up in a drop-down menu. I can create an object in github. Referring rofi source code and reading more documents will help me.
- [ ] Add a curtain to my tower chassis.
- [x] Learn about version corresponding or dependency among cuda, python or so on.
