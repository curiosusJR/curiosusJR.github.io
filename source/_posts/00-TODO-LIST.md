I need a to-do list to help me organize my numerous daily tasks. This list categorizes all of things  I need to do in order of urgency. It will keep some of things that have already done for thinking over their logic when there is a complex situation. The list will be updated daily and irrelevant completed items will be cleared after about a week. If a complex task needs to be broken down into multiple subtasks, those subtasks will be listed in another file and linked here. The file list subtasks should be a document for the complex task and will be retained.
