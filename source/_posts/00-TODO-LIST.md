I need a to-do list to help me organize my numerous daily tasks. This list categorizes all of things  I need to do in order of urgency. It will keep some of things that have already done for thinking over their logic when there is a complex situation. The list will be updated daily and irrelevant completed items will be cleared after about a week. If a complex task needs to be broken down into multiple subtasks, those subtasks will be listed in another file and linked here. The file list subtasks should be a document for the complex task and will be retained.

# Things I need to do **Tomorrow**
- [ ] Searching relevant literature.
- [x] Organize framework and foothold point of my topic.
- [x] Summarize the basic ideas. I mean write a list or something to organize thoughts.

# Things I need to do soon 
- [x] Write a draft of the proposal report for my PhD topic.
	 ## 0407
	 - [ ] to-do: Read literature, evaluate the feasibility of this method. Write my dissertation report. 
		Given a new [research](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pld.2022.11.001) using a similar approach to study phylogeny, my original idea may be feasible. 
		- However, I need to find out a new innovation point for my own project. Specifically, I need deal with trait definition and quantification, modeling the evolution process against this data type, evaluate trait quality in evolutionary analyse, combine multimodal data like pictures and molecular sequences. 
		- Since this is a PhD project, I need to assess whether I can achieve enough results to meet my graduation requirements. Namely I need to plan to publish 3 articles at least.
	
	 ## 0408
	- [ ] Sting out the margin.
	- [ ] Study with the annotation and learn how to definition traits like them.
	
	 ## 0410
	- [ ] Structures outline definition.
	- [ ] Annotation changing.
	- [ ] Traits definition. Maybe same thing to the first point.
	
	 ## 0415
	- [ ] Find out how `append` works and why use it. How to make it correct. i
	
	 ## 0416
	- [ ] When the process is finished, keep checking this error. Up to now, there are a few questions about this error in my mind. 
		1. The assert function limit something must be only one and they are not.
		2. What is meaning of statements followed by asserting manual_images is a list and why. 
		3. Which function create folders in results?
	- [ ] How to evaluate the identification and make it useful for me?
	- [ ] Report my work to my tutor.
	
	 ## 0420
	- [ ] Read articles and prepare for PhD object.
	
	 ## 0421
	- [ ] Search articles totally.

- [ ] Add GitAction on GitHub for automatically deploying Hexo blogs.


# Things I had done recently 
- [x] Network broken retry. Using curl.
- [x] Add this auto-broken-retry script to openwrt.
- [x] Todo list plugin on desktop environment. 
- [x] configure ipv5 on tower.


# Things I need to do sometimes
- [ ] It would be even better if the to-do list could pop up in a drop-down menu. I can create an object in github. Referring rofi source code and reading more documents will help me.
- [ ] Summarize installation and configuration of archlinux.
- [ ] Add a curtain to my tower chassis.
- [ ] Learn about version corresponding or dependency among cuda, python or so on.
- [ ] Systematic learn deep learning programming.
- [x] Learn more about the basic of network technology for a better using of R6S.
- [ ] Install fonts from MacOS and Windows to ubuntu for Latex.
- [x] Solved issue of the remote accessing to openwrt LAN. Something may help here, such as [nat64 in openwrt](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/network/ipv6/nat64), and [others](https://blog.csdn.net/qq_29688717/article/details/129506914), but it needs more settings to complete.
- [ ] The paste action cannot be canceled by default. It had been discussed  [here](https://github.com/erebe/greenclip/issues/27) but all of them are not perfect.
