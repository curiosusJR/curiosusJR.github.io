I need a to-do list to help me organize my numerous daily tasks. This list categorizes all of things  I need to do in order of urgency. It will keep some of things that have already done for thinking over their logic when there is a complex situation. The list will be updated daily and irrelevant completed items will be cleared after about a week. If a complex task needs to be broken down into multiple subtasks, those subtasks will be listed in another file and linked here. The file list subtasks should be a document for the complex task and will be retained.

# Things I need to do **Tomorrow**
- [ ] Searching relevant literature.
- [ ] Summarize the basic ideas. I mean write a list or something to organize thoughts.

# Things I need to do soon 
- [ ] Write a draft of the proposal report for my PhD topic.


# Things I had done recently 
- [x] Network broken retry. Using curl.
- [x] Add this auto-broken-retry script to openwrt.
- [x] Todo list plugin on desktop environment. 
- [x] configure ipv5 on tower.


# Things I need to do sometimes
- [ ] It would be even better if the to-do list could pop up in a drop-down menu. I can create an object in github. Referring rofi source code and reading more documents will help me.
- [ ] Summarize installation and configuration of archlinux.
- [ ] Add a curtain to my tower chassis.
- [ ] Learn about version corresponding or dependency among cuda, python or so on.
- [ ] Systematic learn deep learning programming.
- [x] Learn more about the basic of network technology for a better using of R6S.
- [ ] Install fonts from MacOS and Windows to ubuntu for Latex.
- [x] Solved issue of the remote accessing to openwrt LAN. Something may help here, such as [nat64 in openwrt](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/network/ipv6/nat64), and [others](https://blog.csdn.net/qq_29688717/article/details/129506914), but it needs more settings to complete.
- [ ] The paste action cannot be canceled by default. It had been discussed  [here](https://github.com/erebe/greenclip/issues/27) but all of them are not perfect.
