# Usage
## Planning
1. TODO-list is for work and WISH-list is for life.
2. Add tasks should be done recently into autodaily and finish them in order. 
## Documenting
3. Done the works on the autodaily everyday and summary daily work at autodaily-report.
4. Add tags for tasks in autodaily for linking to items in TODO/WISH-list.
## Work progressing
6. Sketch my thesis on mdbook. (because markdown is easier for both documentation and presentation)
7. Sync the sketches to TODO-list and break it up into exactly tasks.
8. Report my work into mdbook weekly.
## Presentation
9. Use mdbook (for short report), beamer or PPT (for formal report) to show contents in mdbook.
