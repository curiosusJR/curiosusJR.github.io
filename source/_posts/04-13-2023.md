# What I have done today

1. The previous error report of my reproducing CUDNN_STATUS_EXECUTION_FAILED maybe caused by the imcorrespond of version among cuda, cudnn and pytorch [see](https://blog.csdn.net/qq_40506723/article/details/124798992) and [see](https://blog.csdn.net/yu_xinli/article/details/127084720). Updating dependency with conda makes me crazy. It only runs at an extremely slow speed and I cannot change to a source makes me satisfy. I tried to uninstall all of conda and reinstall it but it won't help after trying for several times. I tried to install [mamba](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba) followed by [guide](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).

2. After installed mamba, I installed conda environment with `mamba create env -f conda_environment.yml` after removing several packages' version info or it cannot be found in current sources. Dataset preparation runs well but train still have errors.
	- AttributeError: module 'torchvision.models' has no attribute 'mobilenet_v2'
		It caused by trochvision version is too low, [see](https://blog.51cto.com/u_12001271/5657216). So do `mamba update torchvision`
		- AttributeError: module 'torch.jit' has no attribute 'unused'
			It caused by corresponding problem between pytorch and torchvision, [see](https://blog.csdn.net/ZwaterZ/article/details/125268475). So do `mamba install torchvision==0.14.0 -c nvidia -c pytorch` and install failed. Caused by threads number limited, [see](https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_46779338/article/details/128319080). Use `ulimit -n 2048` and torchvision will be update correctly.
3. Check `mamba list | grep torch` and this will be shown:
	```
	WARNING conda.core.prefix_data:_load_site_packages(291): Problem reading non-conda package record at lib/python3.7/site-packages/certifi-2020.6.20-py3.7.egg-info/PKG-INFO. Please verify that you still need this, and if so, that this is still installed correctly. Reinstalling this package may help.
	 _pytorch_select 0.1    cpu_0 anaconda 
	 pytorch         1.13.1 py3.7_cuda11.7_cudnn8.5.0_0 pytorch 
	 pytorch-cpu     1.1.0  py37he1b5a44_0 conda-forge 
	 pytorch-cuda    11.7   h778d358_3 pytorch 
	 pytorch-mutex   1.0    cuda pytorch 
	 torchvision     0.14.1 py37_cu117 pytorch
	```
	And torch version in python had been 1.1.0. 

# What I need to do next

1. Change pytorch version to 1.13.0 and run train script.

# What I want to do in future
- Learn about version corresponding or dependency among cuda, python or so on.

# What I want to tell myself
Calm down you clever. Just a dependency problem. Solve it quickly and move on!
