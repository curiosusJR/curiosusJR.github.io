# What I have done today

1. SSH Pub-key authentication. It is more safety and convenient because it does not need a password every time to log in.
	1. Use `ssh-keygen && ssh-copy-id <remote server ip>` to add pub keys into server.
	2. Edit local `~/.ssh/config` file, to set a common name, with:
		```
		Host <server name>
			HostName <server ip>
			User <user name>
		```
	3. If pub key authentication cannot success, try to config file `/etc/ssh/ssh_config` and set `StrictModes` option to "no", more about see `man sshd` and `man ssh_config`.
2. Ipv6 configuration in R6S with openwrt followed by [here](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/492774540). Sometime R6S cannot get an ipv6 address from campus net, maybe because of a network error. Reconnect the net cords and wait for a minutes, it will be fine. After the whole configuring, I can visit ipv6 sites in my tower device (connected with R6S by wired LAN). But it does not work on mac which is connected with R6S by wireless LAN. Besides, I cannot visit my ipv6 address outside my LAN because of the nat6. The reason of using nat6 is I can get only one address, not a sub-net, from campus network so I have to use nat6 to forwarding address to other devices.

	    display: inline-block;
	    color: #999;
	    padding: 2px;">
	      It's so cool! But it is sadly that I cannot visit my ipv6 address via WAN.

# What I need to do next

1. Organize my to-do list for my PhD object.

# What I want to do in future
- Solved the remote access issue.

# What I want to tell myself
I think it is time to give up tossing these messes for now. I can just stop ipv6 and use a dumb methods, using Oray X5, because what i need is remote access, not ipv6. Otherwise, configure the network setting cost my too many time. I have lots of other more important business to do.
