# What I have done today

1. Done with using continuous traits using the Revbayes script from [here](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.40b70).
2. Switched the `.csv` format file of traits into `.nexus` format for bayesian analysis with script of myself. Re-organize `csv` files and use [script](c2n) for directly switching and [script](c2n_s) for switching selected number pictures and [script](c2n_culculate_mean) for calculate the mean traits.
3. Bayesian phylogenetic tree had been built using average continuous traits of 26 species.

4. Re-trained inceptionResnetV2 model with 499x499 pix pictures instead of 299.

# What I need to do next
- [ ] Arithmetic average cannot represent the average level of image features. I should use another method.
- [ ]  Evolution model of continuous trait can or cannot be change for better use of image?
- [ ] Are the traits extracted by models the ones I want? Should I train, even build, my own model? Or should I use model for trait extraction? The distance in the kailan-article, what exactly mean in physical or biological?
