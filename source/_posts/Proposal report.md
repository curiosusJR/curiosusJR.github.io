1. to-do: Read literature, evaluate the feasibility of this method. Write my dissertation report. 
	Given a new [research](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pld.2022.11.001) using a similar approach to study phylogeny, my original idea may be feasible. 
	- However, I need to find out a new innovation point for my own project. Specifically, I need deal with trait definition and quantification, modeling the evolution process against this data type, evaluate trait quality in evolutionary analyse, combine multimodal data like pictures and molecular sequences. 
	- Since this is a PhD project, I need to assess whether I can achieve enough results to meet my graduation requirements. Namely I need to plan to publish 3 articles at least.

# 0408
- Sting out the margin.
- Study with the annotation and learn how to definition traits like them.

# 0410

1. Structures outline definition.
2. Annotation changing.
3. Traits definition. Maybe same thing to the first point.

# 0415
1. Find out how `append` works and why use it. How to make it correct. i

1. When the process is finished, keep checking this error. Up to now, there are a few questions about this error in my mind. 
	1. The assert function limit something must be only one and they are not.
	2. What is meaning of statements followed by asserting manual_images is a list and why. 
	3. Which function create folders in results?
2. How to evaluate the identification and make it useful for me?
3. Report my work to my tutor.i

# 0420

1. Read articles and prepare for PhD object.

# 0421

1. Search articles totally.
