# What I have done today

1. Downloaded the whole dataset contain 3792 pictures into `$DIR/raw` and disable its write permission.Renamed files to use '\_' to replace the spaces in files' name by `rename \_  *`.  Used a shell script to re-organize pictures by species: 
	```
	#! /usr/bin/zsh
	
	DIR=`pwd`
	
	# create species-based organized directory if it is not exist
	if [  ! -e $DIR/organized ]
	then
		mkdir $DIR/organized
		cd $DIR/organized
		mkdir `ls $DIR/raw | awk -F _ '{printf "%s_%s\n", $1,$2 }' | uniq`
	fi
	
	
	cd $DIR;
	for i in `ls $DIR/raw`
	do
		spname=`echo $i | awk -F _ '{printf "%s_%s", $1,$2}'`
		cp $DIR/raw/$i  $DIR/organized/$spname
	done;
	```
	Used a shell script for checking if the copy result contain all pictures.
	```
	s=0; 
	for i in `ls organized\`; 
	do 
		 ((s+=`ls organized/$i| wc -l`)); 
	done;
	echo $s;
	``` 
2. Used the whole dataset to extract traits and build phylogeny tree with python script. The dataset contain some broken pictures and python cannot read, so use script from [here](https://blog.csdn.net/qq_44936246/article/details/117962404) to find them out and remove them.
3. I found that the model tree is named `<model_name>.nexus` and the random tree is named `random.nexus` and I was wrong that I placed the model tree under the `../` directory, so I had always used the random trees for checking. I checked the model trees build by the whole dataset, results can be found below:

	    display: inline-block;
	    color: #999;
	    padding: 2px;">
	      Consensus tree of 100 trees built by inceptionResnetV2 model

> "At each internal node is an indication of how often the corresponding group (meaning all taxa descending from that internal node) was found in the set of all trees. (Numbers are percentages)."   [ref](https://teaching.healthtech.dtu.dk/22115/index.php/Consensus_Trees)



# What I need to do next

 - [ ] Build 10000 trees in one week and check it.
