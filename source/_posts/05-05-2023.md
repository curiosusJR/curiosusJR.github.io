# What I have done today

1. Preliminary organized my thinking of the proposal report.

# What I want to tell myself
I have come back from my vocation. Write my reports as draft in markdown.

In my zsh configure, the git-information is shown by p10k plugin in zim. It can be found that the signs meaning in [their github  page](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k/tree/master/gitstatus). Git stash is a temporary action, [more about](https://www.cnblogs.com/tocy/p/git-stash-reference.html).

 In following period of time, my work will be focused on writing my proposal report. For the integrity of the idea, my daily work will be concentrated in the draft of the report, rather than the separate log.
