# What I have done today

1. Reproduced the work of [Tao and Sun (2022)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S246826592200107X?via%3Dihub) using datasets from  [2022SE](https://resjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/syen.12543). 
	1. Download the python 3.8.5 script in supplementary data. The directory should be organized in the way below:
	```
		.
		├── dataset
		│  ├── ...
		├── Learn_pld_376_Supplement 3. Image Cluster Score_mmc3.py
		├── Learn_pld_376_Supplement_2_Image_Clustering_mmc2.py
		├── train
		└── validation
	```
	2. Install the dependence. Use conda for python 3.8.5 installation. Use pip for tensorflow installation.
	3. Change the path and modelSpList for your data. Change the num_classes for your own data. For checking the image file is broken or not, use `ffmpeg` to change the format of images in your dataset.
	4. The script I have edited for my using and adding some annotation can be found [here](Learn_pld_376_Supplement_2_Image_Clustering_mmc2.py) .
	5. When the clustering done, the directory should be added some files like this:
		```
		.
		├── dataset
		│  ├── ...
		├── fine-tune-inceptionResnetV2N.h5
		├── fine-tune-resnet50NN.h5
		├── Learn_pld_376_Supplement 3. Image Cluster Score_mmc3.py
		├── Learn_pld_376_Supplement_2_Image_Clustering_mmc2.py
		├── randomTrees38.nexus
		├── train
		│  ├── ...
		└── validation
		   ├── ...
		```
	6. The file named `randomTrees38.nexus` is 1000 random distance-based trees using inceptionRestnetV2 model. The number and model can be changed in the python script easily after reading it. 
	7. Calculate the consensus tree using [Paup 4.0](http://phylosolutions.com/paup-test/) , which has a detailed [manual](http://phylosolutions.com/paup-documentation/paupmanual.pdf). Simply put, the script of Paup below can calculate the consensus tree. Use `help <command>` in Paup for more info.
		```
		Execute ./randomTree38.nexus
		contree /majrule=yes percent=50 LE50=yes treefile=consensus_1000_inceptionResnetV2.nexus;
		```
# What I need to do next

1. Change number and models for testing and retry.
2. Check the plots of epoch accuracy for the model. Check the topology of consensus tree and the SSI value using the script in Supplement 3.
