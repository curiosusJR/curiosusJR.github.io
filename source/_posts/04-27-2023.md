# What I have done today

1. Completed ipv6 setting on R6S, followed [here]( https://blog.csdn.net/LawssssCat/article/details/104443072). 
	1. Use `socat` followed [here](https://www.right.com.cn/forum/forum.php?mod=viewthread&tid=4129434&page=1#pid11351439) for visiting LAN from ipv6-WAN. (This might be nat64.) 
		**It must be turned off the VPN or ip will be changed.** 
	2. At the last, set a firewall in openwrt. Ipv6 WAN connection from TCP/UDP will be forwarded to selected port in selected LAN host (refer other default setting). Now, I can visit local servers using \[ipv6\]:\<port\> address. 
	3. The ipv6 address can be changed when I restart my network server or reboot. So I need a DDNS service and a new domain name. Buy one from [aliyun](https://wanwang.aliyun.com/?spm=5176.21213303.1158081.1.590d53c9p19xoF&scm=20140722.S_card@@%E5%95%86%E5%93%81@@212429.S_card0.ID_card@@%E5%95%86%E5%93%81@@212429-RL_%E5%9F%9F%E5%90%8D%E6%B3%A8%E5%86%8C-OR_ser-V_2-P0_0) and set dns/ddns services followed [here](https://blog.csdn.net/qq_45704640/article/details/113653488).

2. Add a new testing user on tower-server for others to link to later by `sudo adduser`.
# What I want to tell myself

A few days recently, I focused on my LAN and its remote connection. It takes some time for solving various issues I did not familiar with before. The remaining im-perfections are my tower server security. I do not know if current solution is secure enough. But I think it is securely enough because of campus networks and I do not have many valuable things.

It is really time to do something serious.
