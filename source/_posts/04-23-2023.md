# What I have done today

1. Problem of Safari network connection had been solved by changing DNS service. It should not be `8.8.8.8` or `114.114.114.114`. Deleted options related in DHCP configuration which in `/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf`. 
	- *Additionally, DNS configure file can be found [here](https://blog.csdn.net/OceanWaves1993/article/details/128217710). Edit `/etc/systemd/resolved.conf`, run `systemctl restart systemd-resolved.service` and add link by `sudo ln -s /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf /etc/`*.
2. Installed [Friendlywrt](https://wiki.friendlyelec.com/wiki/index.php/How_to_Build_FriendlyWrt), a variant of [openwrt](https://openwrt.org) on R6S, to instead of Friendlyelec-ubuntu. Considering the specialization and complexity of configuration, the operating system for router is better than Ubuntu. Especially, the setting of dhcp or slaac assignation of ipv6 address in ubuntu needs configure network interfaces (more info see `man interfaces`) but the default network configuration is using `network-manager`. Changing `interfaces` config file will cover settings in `network-manager` and I do not know how to combine them. The interfaces cannot be configured for ap router easily for me and the Ubuntu system takes more spaces and ram. Besides, I do not know how to check which ips I have used in Ubuntu. Considering I may have more complex needs in the future, compared to edit every thing from zero, I prefer to use configure-completed and powerful `openwrt`.
    1. Friendlywrt operating system installation is very easy by following [their wiki](https://wiki.friendlyelec.com/wiki/index.php/NanoPi_R6S/zh). 
    2. Use tower for network sharing to R6S in order to install python and pip by `opkg update && opkg install python3 && wget <get-pip3.py> && python get-pip3.py` and then use `pip install srun-cli` to install the campus network auto-authentication program.
    3. Maintain the LAN topology and tplink wireless router sets to ap mode.
    4. Reset nas [auto mount](http://zhangdeweb.site/2023/04/22/04-22-2023) in `tower.ubuntu`.

# What I need to do next

1. Set ip address, ipv6 and other settings in Friendlywrt. Be familiar with openwrt/Friendlywrt system. [Done](https://zhangdeweb.site/2023/04/24/04-24-2023/)
2. Check the previous todo list and add tags for them. [Done](https://zhangdeweb.site/2023/04/23/04-23-2023/)
    *The speed of network is not slow. Maybe the speed of campus network is erratic.*
