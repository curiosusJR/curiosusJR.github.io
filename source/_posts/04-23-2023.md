# What I have done today

1. Problem of Safari network connection had been solved by changing DNS service. It should not be `8.8.8.8` or `114.114.114.114`. Deleted options related in DHCP configuration which in `/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf`. 
	- *Additionally, DNS configure file can be found [here](https://blog.csdn.net/OceanWaves1993/article/details/128217710). Edit `/etc/systemd/resolved.conf`, run `systemctl restart systemd-resolved.service` and add link by `sudo ln -s /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf /etc/`*.
