# What I have done today

1. Ran the training script with a little change.
	- Most errors I met before caused by version corresponding among torch, torchvision, cuda, cudnn. Especially, remove `_pytorch.select` package in conda to use pytorch with gpu. Recreate environment of  'rsfin' followed by:
	```
	conda install pytorch==1.13.0 torchvision==0.14.0 torchaudio==0.13.0 pytorch-cuda=11.7 -c pytorch -c nvidia # to solve problem with some models not found in torchvision.  
	- mamba update ffmpeg # to solve problem with libopenh264.so.5 not found
	```
	And errors occurred in line 23 `torchvision.transforms.RandomRotation(20, resample=Image.BILINEAR)`: 
	```
	 TypeError: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'resample'
	```
	This caused by torchvision version changing. See `help(torchvision.transforms.RandomRotation)` in python and report: 
	```
	class RandomRotation(torch.nn.modules.module.Module)
	 |  RandomRotation(degrees, interpolation=<InterpolationMode.NEAREST: 'nearest'>, expand=False, center=None, fill=0)
	 |  
	 |  Rotate the image by angle.
	 |  If the image is torch Tensor, it is expected
	 |  to have [..., H, W] shape, where ... means an arbitrary number of leading dimensions.
	 |  
	 |  Args:
	 |      degrees (sequence or number): Range of degrees to select from.
	 |          If degrees is a number instead of sequence like (min, max), the range of degrees
	 |          will be (-degrees, +degrees).
	 |      interpolation (InterpolationMode): Desired interpolation enum defined by
	 |          :class:`torchvision.transforms.InterpolationMode`. Default is ``InterpolationMode.NEAREST``.
	 |          If input is Tensor, only ``InterpolationMode.NEAREST``, ``InterpolationMode.BILINEAR`` are supported.
	 |          For backward compatibility integer values (e.g. ``PIL.Image[.Resampling].NEAREST``) are still accepted,
	 |          but deprecated since 0.13 and will be removed in 0.15. Please use InterpolationMode enum.
	 ... ...
	```
	Interpolation and resample are two kinds of method in image processing. The difference between them is that interpolation is one way to realize resampling for separate data, [see](https://www.jianshu.com/p/4b89d0d323e1). And the difference between NEAREST and BILINEAR is that BILINEAR is more delicate, [see](https://www.codenong.com/cs105851870/). So change the code to `torchvision.transforms.RandomRotation(20, interpolation=Image.BILINEAR)` and all will be fine.
2. Tried to run model test and error occurred in line 13 and 16. Variable `config.TESTING_MODEL_WEIGHTS.items()` do not have parameter `folder_name` and `mtype`. 
3. Went to the jobs fair and listened to the reports of Shaanxi insect society.
	 4 articles in CAS(Chinese Academy of Science) 1 = 35w/year
	  4 articles in CAS 2 = 25w/year
	  Few choice.
	 - Prof. Cao yanghui suggests that do not merge morphological traits dataset into molecular datasets because of the quantity difference and the unclear weighting rules. 

# What I need to do next

1. Solve the weights value problem. Read codes and it is easy.

# What I want to do in future
- Systematic learn deep learning programming.

# What I want to tell myself
The basic problem in the whole 'version error' is that my GPU do not support torch version 1.5 and conda cannot install all dependency they listed. So I have to change some packages in the dependency. The newer package I use have some change in grammar. Luckily, I found out where the problem is and solved it at last.
