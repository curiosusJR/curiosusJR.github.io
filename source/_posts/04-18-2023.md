# What I have done today

1. The error occurred yesterday caused by using an incomplete model weight file, [see](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/340908578). Re-trained model and used new directory path. Running completed.  
2. The identify result is not pretty good. Because I did not organize these pictures in class carefully and I used the full picture including different structures. This time, I tried to use the results of [04.07](https://zhangdeweb.site/2023/04/07/04-07-2023/) which includes pictures of separate structures.  
	1. Copy result folders to the datasets directory and rename it to 'raw'. Remove files that do not need. 
	2. Organize files using [a shell-script](test.txt).
	3. Start running that series of programs and get results.

# What I need to do next

1. Evaluate the results.
