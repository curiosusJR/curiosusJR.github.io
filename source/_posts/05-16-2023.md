# What I have done today

1. Installed sabaki, a desktop app for go game. Install the `.AppImage` file from [its github](https://github.com/SabakiHQ/Sabaki/releases/tag/v0.52.2) and create a desktop file in `/usr/local/applications/` for it.
2. Installl the latest version from [github](https://github.com/SabakiHQ/Sabaki/releases/tag/v0.52.2). I had installed the TensorRT version followed:
 <https://github.com/lightvector/KataGo#opencl-vs-cuda-vs-tensorrt-vs-eigen>. (zip installation will report errors that tensorrt version mismatch. Build from source will solve this issue, [see](https://github.com/lightvector/KataGo/issues/770) )
	1. So I need to install `tensorrt 8.5` using `.deb` package first followed: <https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/tensorrt/archives/tensorrt-853/quick-start-guide/index.html#installing-debian>. *Remember to install the CUDA 11.8 for this which means change the link of `/usr/local/cuda`. Use `stat /usr/local/cudd` to check which version it links to.* 
	2. Use `sudo apt-cache madison tensorrt` to check the installable version and select the correct one to install. If it cannot install its depends, trying to install depends on `/var/nv-tensorrt-local-repo-*/*.dev`. 
	3. After installing tensorrt, reboot.  
	4. Build from source, followed by [here](https://github.com/lightvector/KataGo/blob/master/Compiling.md). Installation locate at `~/.opt/katago`.
	5. Install the larger (40 block network) network [model](https://github.com/lightvector/KataGo/releases/download/v1.4.5/g170-b40c256x2-s5095420928-d1229425124.bin.gz) from <https://github.com/lightvector/KataGo/releases/tag/v1.4.5>.
	6. [Usage](https://github.com/lightvector/KataGo#how-to-use). 
	7. Add katago gtp -model <> -config <> in sabaki.
