# What I have done today

1. Improved the [network-broken-retry-script](network-broken-retry.txt). Something about [reading from files](https://blog.csdn.net/yogima/article/details/128833660) and [checking numbers of lines in file](https://blog.csdn.net/pearl8899/article/details/108522763). The websites for checking network connection are included in `/root/.Network_Connection_Test_List`. Log file will be written in `/root/` when all the test sites are inaccessible and re-try for login.
2. Using systemd.network to config ethernet card by checking `man systemd.network`. 

# What I want to do in future
- Enable ipv4 in enp3s0 and disable ipv4 in enp0s31f6. Disable ipv6 in enp3s0 and enable ipv6 in enp0s31f6.
