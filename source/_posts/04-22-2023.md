# What I have done today

1. Configured router with ap mode but no remote connection for its best performance. 
	1. Use TpLink AX3000 XDR3010 which support ap mode to connect to R6S. R6S has a powerful CPU and TpLink has a higher speed than the previous wireless router, Oray X5. Compared with routing mode, ap mode make all devices under a same local network without creating a new subnet, [see](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/349604997). Otherwise, it may improve performance by reducing forward times and letting the more powerful CPU of R6S deal with events. Since then, compared with previous one, the new scheme can improve Wi-FI speed and CPU efficiency in only one LAN.  
	2. Ap mode of TpLink Wi-Fi router can be open after setting `network setting - wired - ipv4 - shared to other computer` in LAN network controller of R6S.
	3. Configure DHCP for R6S, followed [here](http://linuxfordevices.com/tutorials/ubuntu/dhcp-server-on-ubuntu) and [a Chinese guide](https://www.codenong.com/cs105867978) and [another one](https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_52365243/article/details/127344447). Fixed IP address should **NOT** be in DHCP and remember to cancel the annotation of `authoritative`. But it still cannot check which ip has been used and manage them in an easy way. Maybe there is a application can help me.
	4. Because of IP address changing, I need to reset my NAS auto-mounting by `sudo vim /etc/fstab` and `sudo mount -a`. 
	5. Installed Oray pgyvpn in docker but because of using subnet it is not better than connecting Oray X5. IPV6 is not a good choice, either. 
2. Solved the problem of Latex package manager `tlmgr` cannot be found in `sudo`, followed by [here](https://www.douban.com/note/557555838/?_i=2084163zFaZOiT,2166830zFaZOiT). Run `sudo visudo` and add the `/bin` path into `Defaults secure_path`.


# What I want to do in future
- Connect Oray X5. Try to find out how to manage IPs in R6S.
- The connection in safari of iPhone is very slow. Find out the reason. [Done](https://zhangdeweb.site/2023/04/23/04-23-2023/)
- Learn more about the basic of network technology for a better using of R6S.
- Install fonts from MacOS and Windows to ubuntu for Latex.
