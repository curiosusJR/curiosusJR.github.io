# What I have done today

1. The dataset I used was wrong. It only contain the outgroups so I re-downloaded dataset with `zenodo_get` from <https://zenodo.org/record/5866217#.ZGxPMdJBwUE>. 
2. Changed `batch_size=30, epochs=500` in model settings, `voteTimes=500` in distance calculation, `treeNum=10000` in random tree generation and re-run the script. Consensus tree was calculated in the same way to yesterday. Checked the results in Figtree and found that species from same genus did not get together and the results of two runs with different paramerters were significantly different. I should use whole dataset to try again and use different parameters to find out the if it will convergence to a situation or not.
3. Image features were extracted by function `get_image_feature` in supplementary file 2 with [Keras](https://keras.io/).  There is a global variable `picDic` recorded all features of pictures randomly selected in all species in `get_image_feature` function. After running the whole script, I can output `picDic` to a `.csv` file for getting the raw feature data. The feature data is a 1 d array contain normalized RGB information, which means it does not contain location correlation information. **This part can be further optimized.** Output `picDic` to `.csv` used the script below:
	```
	for i in picDic.keys():
	    f=open("../output/"+i.split('/')[1]+".csv", "a", encoding="utf-8")
	    np.savetxt("./output/out_"+i+".csv", picDic[i], fmt='%f', delimiter=',', newline=' ' ,encoding='utf-8')
	```
	And then I can get 813 files which is the length of `picDic` and every file contain 1536 continuous features.

# What I need to do next

 - [ ] Use whole dataset with different settings and model to conduct trees and check the topology. Current (newer one) parameters shows a worse result in the curve plots. Try more.
 - [ ] RevBayes can deal with continuous traits and mrbayes cannot. Try to build trees in a bayes way.
 - [ ] Official suggesting that:
	```
	Deprecated: tf.keras.preprocessing APIs do not operate on tensors and are not recommended for new code. Prefer loading data with either tf.keras.utils.text_dataset_from_directory or tf.keras.utils.image_dataset_from_directory, and then transforming the output tf.data.Dataset with preprocessing layers. These approaches will offer better performance and intergration with the broader Tensorflow ecosystem. For more information, see the tutorials for [loading text]( https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/load_data/text), [loading images]( https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/load_data/images), and [augmenting images]( https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/data_augmentation), as well as the [preprocessing layer guide]( https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/preprocessing_layers).
