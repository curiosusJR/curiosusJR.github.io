# What I have done today

1. Previous application launcher process, `dmenu`, is not really good for me. It is difficultly to configure so I decide to turn to [`rofi`](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi), a modern application launcher and windows switcher to replace `dmenu`. 
	1. Installation with `sudo apt install rofi` and remove `dmenu`.
	2. Download themes for `rofi` from [here](https://github.com/newmanls/rofi-themes-collection). More about [usage](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi/wiki/Themes) and [rofi config](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi/blob/next/CONFIG.md). Followed by the documents, move theme files to `~/.config/rofi/themes` and preview themes by running `rofi -modi run -show run` and select `rofi-theme-selector`. Set default theme by editing `rofi` config file, which created by command `rofi -dump-config > ~/.config/rofi/config.rasi`, to add `@theme "MyTheme"` in the end following `configuration {}`. Use `rofi -help`  to check configuration file path. Fonts and other settings can be edit in theme files.
	3. `Rofi` has several built-in modes implementing common use cases. Here is the differences of commonly used ones.
		-   **run**: launch applications from $PATH, with option to launch in terminal.
		-   **drun**: launch applications based on desktop files. It tries to be compliant to the XDG standard.
		-   **window**: Switch between windows on an EWMH compatible window manager.
		-   **ssh**: Connect to a remote host via ssh.
		-   **filebrowser**: A basic file-browser for opening files.
	4. Configure `i3wm` to change application launcher.
		```
		# annotate dmenu command
		# bindsym $mod+d exec --no-startup-id dmenu_run -fn DejaVu-25 
		# A more modern dmenu replacement is rofi:
		bindsym $mod+d exec --no-startup-id "rofi -modi drun,run -show drun "
		bindsym $mod+w exec --no-startup-id "rofi -modi drun,run,window -show window 

		# remember to remove conflicting shortcuts
		```
	5. Modes `drun` launch applications based on desktop files. The way to add application to the menu is that add `.desktop` file in directory `/usr/share/applications/`. An easy way for adding is copy another file and edit the appropriate lines for name, exec, and icon. It is recommended to use full path. It seems like relate to `xdg`, so may be `man xdg-open`, `man xdg-settings` can tell more.
2. Training models with my own pictures dataset from Dr. Liang Zonglei. 
	1. Edit dataset path and re-organize files in dataset folder. *Remember: **DO NOT** only use number as file name or as the start of file name, or error occur with function `len()` during training.* 
	2. Prepare dataset and train. All will be fine. When train is done, change `TESTING_MODEL_WEIGHTS` to current folder name.
	3. Testing datasets and new error occurred.

# What I need to do next

1. Keep debugging. 

# What I want to tell myself
Today I find that the thing I did recently is debugging for codes. It does not have much  fun to me. When I have done with it, I should find out a scientific question and focus on natural history.
